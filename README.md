# BillScraper

## Digital Ocean

Digitalocean.com -> login -> username > password -> button to log in  
-> billing -> view details -> view invoice > save as?  

## Thoughts  

Scalable solution?  
Every website is different  
Allow people to run through the website once, save their clicks, and play them back w/ selenium each time they want an invoice?
